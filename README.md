# Oddsium Assessment - Caesar's API Integration

This application was built by David Sanvicente as an evaluation for employiment by Oddsium USA. The app displays current/live sports odds for a number of sports and also accepts williamhill.com login information, returning the user profile data and displaying user's account email and current balance in the Header component. The full profile object will be logged to console. Note: On smaller screens/mobile, the Header menu collapses into a dropdown.

# Credentials
